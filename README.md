arduino_anemometer
==================

This is a little anemometer project I've started.

Sensor is from http://shop.moderndevice.com/products/wind-sensor

My main idea behind this is to allow me to measure the air flow coming out of the vents in my house but it could be used for all kinds of neat stuff.

This is still very early in its life cycle. I'll probably end up pulling the data from 2-3 of these so I can get approx the same air flow in the rooms upstairs since thats the problem area
